## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview

Duplicate records are a major issue in modern datasets, especially those involving multimedia or large-scale image repositories.  
This notebook explores multiple methods for identifying and removing duplicates using **visual hashing, correlation matrices, and similarity metrics**.


 ## Features

-  **Perceptual Hashing**: Identifies exact and near-duplicate images using imagehash algorithms
-  **Deep Learning Embeddings**: Uses MobileNet-v2 for semantic similarity analysis
-  **Interactive Visualization**: Explore and analyze results with FiftyOne's web interface
-  **Dataset Management**: Load, clean, and organize image collections efficiently
-  **Batch Processing**: Handles datasets of various sizes with optimized processing
-  **Customizable Thresholds**: Adjustable sensitivity for different use cases

## Results

### Dataset Processing
- **Total Images Processed**: 51 images successfully loaded and analyzed
- **Dataset Format**: ImageDirectory format with proper metadata integration
- **Embedding Computation**: All 51 images processed with MobileNet-v2 embeddings

### Duplicate Detection Results
The system identified **8 potential duplicate pairs** .

### Performance Metrics
- **Embedding Computation**: 55.4 seconds for 51 images (0.9 samples/second)
- **Hash Computation**: 62.0 milliseconds for 51 images (822.9 samples/second)
- **Memory Usage**: Efficient processing with no memory issues reported
-  The system demonstrated robust performance in identifying both exact duplicates (distance=0) and near-duplicates with varying similarity levels, making it suitable for dataset cleaning and quality control workflows.
